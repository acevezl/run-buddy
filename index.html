            <p>You like to use words like <em>jiggle</em> and <em>twizzle</em>. You like to use words about running.
                But when you stop your talking, your mind turns straight to jumping.
                Sometimes I look at you and I look into your eyes,
                I notice the way you think about jumping with a smile,
                Curved lips you just can't disguise.
                But you think it's running making your life worthwhile.
                Why is it so hard for you to decide which you love more?
                Running or...
                Jumping?</p>

                        You moonwalk and the flashback starts:
                        The beach is where I'm standing in the Sunday air. So this is me running,
                        Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry!"
                        And I go back to Sunday all the time.
                        It turns out freedom ain't nothing but crashing energetically,
                        I'd go back to Sunday, turn around and do some bashing.
                        I go back to Sunday quite often.

                        I grew up overshadowed by steep estuaries.
                        Couldn't catch the eye of no city boy.

                        Here I am devoted to Harry.
                        How I love the way you look in your gold jeans.
                        Can't believe I let the smog cloud my eye.

                        Where the steep estuaries stand.
                        And the lush ditches surround.
                        I'll ride my tattered truck with you by my side.
